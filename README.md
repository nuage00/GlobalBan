# Global Ban

This repository replaces the old Rocketmod 4 version that is the base of this forked repository.
With this plugin, you can ban players off your Unturned 3 server without having to ban them in all servers one by one.


## Current Features

`/ban <player> [time] [reason]` - Bans a player for `[time]` (seconds) with the specified reason. Note that the reason does not have to be in double quotes (`"reason"`)

`/banhistory [player]` - Displays the last 4 bans of a player or yourself. (Cannot display bans of console, so this will instead throw a friendly exception).

`/bans [player]` - Displays the total number of bans in the server as well as how many are active. If a player is specified, it will instead display the number of bans they have, as well as how many are active.

`/kick <player> [reason]` - Kicks a player with the specified reason.

`/slay <player> [reason]` - Kills and permanently bans the player for the specified reason.

`/unban <player>` - Unbans the specific player. This can also be their IP or their HWID as displayed in the DB.


`/ban` has a configuration option that allows it to no longer provide IP & HWID bans, but `/slay` will always support IP & HWID banning.


If a player goes on an alt account and they have their IP / HWID banned, this alt account will also be banned automatically and permanently.


Discord webhook support is also present for the following commands: `/ban`, `/kick`, `/slay`, `/unban`.
It is also available when the player tries to evade a ban.


## Database Stored Data

The database currently stores the following values:
- Ban Entry ID (Id)
- Steam 64 ID of the banned player (PlayerId)
- IP Address (IP)
- Hardware ID (HWID)
- Steam 64 ID of the Admin (AdminId)
- The reason of the ban (Reason)
- The duration of the ban (Duration)
- The Server ID related to the ban [See PIL's Servers table] (ServerId)
- The Date when the player has been banned (TimeOfBan)
- If this ban no longer counts no matter of the time remaining (IsUnbanned)
